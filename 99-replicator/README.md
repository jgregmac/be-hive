# Kubernetes Replicator

It's a tool for replicating secrets and configMaps between namespaces.  Useful
especially for TLS certificates generated by cert-manager.

Put this service asside for now.  We instead will try to use "Reflector" since
replicator is not working in our cluster, probably because I am trying to run it with
low privileges and this scenario is not well documented.  In general, Replicator is not
terribly well documented.
